# Student README

This is _your_ README. Use this space to share how you approached the problems of this project. This need not be a diary, but should contain information about decisions you made, challenges you faced, and your understanding of the content of the project. 

You should answer these questions thoroughly. You may include additional informations as you see fit.   
- What design choices did you make? Why? 
- How did you test your code? 
- What changes would you make to the application/project?
